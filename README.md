## Introduction
Hello! My name is Brady, and I am a young professional dedicated to continuously improving and growing my professional and creative skillsets. I am a soon-to-be graduate of Southern New Hampshire University, studying Computer Science, Data Analysis, and Applied Mathematics. I am an incoming graduate student at the University of Central Florida, studying Industrial Engineering. Lastly, I am a full-time Imagineer at Walt Disney Imagineering, where I specialize in facilitating and administering the process of bidding, selecting, and contracting out work packages to vendors in the themed entertainment and construction industries.

Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated and excellent with numbers. During my pre-college years, I avoided specializing in STEM since it seemed to be a field saturated with talent, but after having the opportunity to dive into the world of business through my work in Theme Parks and my completion of a Bachelors in Entertainment Mangement, it was clear that my talent for numbers could be incredibly valuable. Through internships focusing on Data Analytics at Universal Orlando Resort and Disney Live Entertainment, I quickly learned and then reached the limits of what Excel and Power BI could do for me, and I wanted to expand my skill set into more advanced tools, most of which involved some form of programming. One Bachelor's in Computer Science later, and I'm ready to take on the bigger and better challenge of a Master's in Industrial Engineering, and see just how far I can go with my passion for data analysis, process improvement, and problem-solving.

During my fourteen months at Southern New Hampshire University, I've taken seventeen classes while working full-time for most of my studies (remember, a typical full-time college student only takes ten classes a year!). Through this rigorous program, I've been introduced to dozens of tools such as Python, SQL, Java, C++, R, half a dozen IDEs, MATLAB, LaTeX, Jupyter Notebook, and more. I was eager to take additional advanced math classes, which have improved my logical and critical thinking skills drastically; I took Data Structures & Algorithms, which introduced new methods of problem solving, and I even took full-stack development, where I was able to create entire web applications. Through my work on dozens of projects, I was able to focus on different areas ranging from software security, databases, client-server development, and even some data analysis classes to hone my existing skillset and focus on how to apply my learnings to a business environment, such as collaboraiting with teams and communicating with stakeholders.

My portfolio focuses on my programming/software engineering skills, my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and my ability to create databases and dashboards. I hope my portfolio serves as a first impression for the quality of work I strive to provide, and sheds some light on the value I can bring to an organization.

## Artifact: C++ Binary Search Tree (BST) CSV Parser
- This program is written in C++ and parses a CSV file, stores it in a binary search tree, and then performs functions such as reading, searching, and deleting items in the tree. This was created for our Data Structures and Algorithms class at Southern New Hampshire University. The code created by me in this program is focused on the BST data structure and includes the constructor, destructor, the pre/in/post-order traversals, the insertion methods, deletion methods, and search methods, totalling approximately 150 original LOC. I chose this artifact because it came with a robust data set that would be excellent to use in later enhancements. 
### Enhancement 1 - Software Design & Engineering - Refactor to Python
- I refactored the program from C++ to Python. The original program was approximately 1000 LOC, and the refactored Python program had approximately 250 LOC with equivalent functionality and faster runtimes, and was further modularized to enhance readability. This shows my understanding of the differences between compiled and interpreted languages and my ability to use Python, the most used language in my field: data analysis.
- In enhancing this artifact, I was able to simplify the code and split it into multiple Python files, resulting in cleaner and more readable code. I learned how the various data structures work between languages, and while I thought that my Python program would be slower and less ideal for this use-case, everything ran much quicker in Python than it did with the C++ code, though this may be due to improvements I made in the code or other external factors.
### Enhancement 2 - Data Structures & Algorithms - Refactor to Red-Black Tree (RBT)
- I refactored the program from a BST to a self-balancing RBT. This data structure improves the worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion functions in a tree from O(n) for the BST to O(log n) for the RBT, with little to no drawbacks.
- This was a tricky enhancement, as I ultimately had to refactor almost all my existing code to remove any recursive calls, but I'm incredibly satisfied by how it turned out, and it shows the power of clear organization and outlines in programming.
### Enhancement 3 - Databases - SQLite-linked Dashboard with Access Control
- I started from scratch and parsed the CSV file to a SQLite database, and then linekd the database to a Streamlit Dashboard which includes an implementation of access control.
- While the programming of this dashboard was new to me, it quickly became intuitive and allowed me to flex my muscles in data analysis and reporting, a skillset very familiar to me, but an area in which most of my best work is under NDA.
