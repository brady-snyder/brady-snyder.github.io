## Artifact: C++ Binary Search Tree (BST) CSV Parser
- This program is written in C++ and parses a CSV file, stores it in a binary search tree, and then performs functions such as reading, searching, and deleting items in the tree. This was created for our Data Structures and Algorithms class at Southern New Hampshire University. The code created by me in this program is focused on the BST data structure and includes the constructor, destructor, the pre/in/post-order traversals, the insertion methods, deletion methods, and search methods, totalling approximately 150 original LOC. I chose this artifact because it came with a robust data set that would be excellent to use in later enhancements. 
### Enhancement 1 - Software Design & Engineering - Refactor to Python
- I refactored the program from C++ to Python. The original program was approximately 1000 LOC and the refactored Python program had approximately 250 LOC with equivalent functionality and faster runtimes, and was further modularized to enhance readability. This shows my understanding of the differences between compiled and interpreted languages and my ability to use Python, the most used language in my field: data analysis.
- In enhancing this artifact, I was able to simplify the code and split it into multiple Python files, resulting in cleaner and more readable code. I learned how the various data structures work between languages, and while I thought that my Python program would be slower and less ideal for this use-case, everything ran much quicker in Python than it did with the C++ code, though this may be due to improvements I made in the code or other external factors.
### Enhancement 2 - Data Structures & Algorithms - Refactor to Red-Black Tree (RBT)
- I refactored the program from a BST to a self-balancing RBT. This data structure improves the worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion functions in a tree from O(n) for a BST to O(log n) for the RBT, with little to no drawbacks.
### Enhancement 3 - Databases - SQLite-linked Dashboard with Access Control
